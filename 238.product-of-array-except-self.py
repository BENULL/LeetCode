#
# Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1, Â return an array output such
# that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except
# nums[i].
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input:  [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [24,12,8,6]
# 
# 
# Constraint:Â It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or
# suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.
# 
# Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).
# 
# Follow up:
# Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not
# count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
#

class Solution:
    # Given numbers [2, 3, 4, 5], regarding the third number 4, the product of array except 4 is 2*3*5 which consists of two parts: left 2*3 and right 5. 
    # The product is left*right. 
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [1]*len(nums)
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            res[i] = res[i-1]*nums[i-1]
        right = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)-2,-1,-1):
            right *= nums[i+1]
            res[i] *= right
        return res
