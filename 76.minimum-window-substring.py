# Testcase Example:  '"ADOBECODEBANC"\n"ABC"'
#
# Given two strings s and t, return the minimum window in s which will contain
# all the characters in t. If there is no such window in s that covers all
# characters in t, return the empty string "".
# 
# Note that If there is such a window, it isÂ guaranteed that there will always
# be only one unique minimum window in s.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
# Output: "BANC"
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "a", t = "a"
# Output: "a"
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5
# s and t consist of English letters.
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(n) time?

        need, missing = collections.Counter(t), len(t)
        i = I = J = 0
        for j,c in enumerate(s,1):
            missing -= need[c]>0
            need[c] -= 1

                    i+=1
