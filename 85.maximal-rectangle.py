#
# Given a rows x colsÂ binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest
# rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: matrix =
# [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: matrix = []
# Output: 0
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: matrix = [["0"]]
# Output: 0
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: matrix = [["1"]]
# Output: 1
# 
# 
# Example 5:
# 
# 
# Input: matrix = [["0","0"]]
# Output: 0
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# rows == matrix.length
# cols == matrix[i].length
# 0 <= row, cols <= 200
# matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
#
