#
# Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly
# linked lists begins.
# 
# For example, the following two linked lists:
# 
# 
# begin to intersect at node c1.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA =
# 2, skipB = 3
# Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
# Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not
# be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as
# [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes
# before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected
# node in B.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# 
# Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3,
# skipB = 1
# Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
# Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not
# be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as
# [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes
# before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected
# node in B.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# 
# Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
# Output: null
# Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of
# B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must
# be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
# Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Notes:
# 
# 
# If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
# The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function
# returns.
# You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked
# structure.
# Each value on each linked list is in the range [1, 10^9].
# Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.
#

        Maintain two pointers pApA and pBpB initialized at the head of A and B, respectively. Then let them both traverse through the lists, one node at a time.
        When pApA reaches the end of a list, then redirect it to the head of B (yes, B, that's right.); similarly when pBpB reaches the end of a list, redirect it the head of A.
        If at any point pApA meets pBpB, then pApA/pBpB is the intersection node.
