# Testcase Example:  '[1,2]'
#
# Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 1->2
# Output: false
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: 1->2->2->1
# Output: true
# 
# Follow up:
# Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):

#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    # Phase 1: Reverse the first half while finding the middle.
    # Phase 2: Compare the reversed first half with the second half.
